Late rise is required to allow lady to pass the man.Too early a rise will stop her. See note below.Need to drag heel on the closed impetus. Feet should not come together until weight is committed to RF. Thatâ€™s going to provide the signal for the lady to commit her weight on her left foot.Turn continues on the ball of the foot through the 3rd stepCount 3: LF to side and slightly back | Backing DC against the LOD | TH | 1/4 between 2-3 | Sway(S) | Up.

Spine tilted left, hip to Lady, so it won&#39;t gap.Do not turn feet when rotating/twisting the frame (CBM).Think about stepping forward through step 2, don&#39;t start turning too soon.

Leader maintains one track.Head stay far left.Count 2: RF fwd in CBMP | FLOD | HT | Cont to turn | Sway(S) | CBM | Rise e/o 5This is a large step, as the leader is on the outside of the turn.

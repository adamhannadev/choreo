Late rise is required to allow lady to pass the man.Too early a rise will stop her. See note below.Need to drag heel on the closed impetus. Feet should not come together until weight is committed to RF. That’s going to provide the signal for the lady to commit her weight on her left foot.Turn continues on the ball of the foot through the 3rd stepCount 3: LF to side and slightly back | Backing DC against the LOD | TH | 1/4 between 2-3 | Sway(S) | Up.

Spine tilted left, hip to Lady, so it won&#39;t gap.Do not turn feet when rotating/twisting the frame (CBM).Think about stepping forward through step 2, don&#39;t start turning too soon.
